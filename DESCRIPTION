Title:  Simple tools for Open Office Word Processing XML documents
Description:  This is a collection of some general and quite simple facilities accessing common 
  elements from within R of an Open XML Word Procesing document, Microsoft's current format.
  These provide examples for accessing the contents of the document and its meta-data.
  More will be added for modifying the content, and also reading richer structures.
  At present, this is more an illustration of what is possible and a way to encourage others
  to explore these documents.  We can do very similar things for OpenOffice documents. (See
  ROpenOffice for a start.)
Imports: XML, Rcompression, methods, ROOXML
Depends: ROOXML
Suggests: rimage
